# About EGOCache 2.x
EGOCache is a simple, thread-safe key value cache store.  It has native support for `NSString`, `UI/NSImage`, and `NSData`, but can store anything that implements `<NSCoding>`.  All cached items expire after the timeout, which by default, is one day.

# Requirements

* ARC
* Blocks
* iOS or OS X

### Installation with Carthage (iOS 8+)
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a lightweight dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C. It leverages CocoaTouch modules and ins less invasive than CocoaPods.
To install with Carthage, follow the instruction on [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

# Changes in 2.0

The public interface in 2.0 is largely the same, with the exception of `[EGOCache currentCache]` being deprecated in favor of `[EGOCache globalCache]`.  You can now create your own instances of EGOCache and tell it to store wherever, this can be good for dividing up caches in different sections of your app.

Internally, EGOCache was largely rewritten to take advantage of libdispatch and is far more stable/performant when handling saves from multiple threads than it was in the past.

One other notable internal change for users upgrading from 1.0 to be aware of, is UIImage's are no longer stored via `UIImagePNGRepresentation`.  They're stored now by archiving UIImage itself, which allows us to retain information such as image scale, orientation, and also store the image in it's native type, so JPEG's are no longer inflated to PNG sizes.  If you were previously saving images via `setImage:forKey:`, but for some reason retrieving them via `dataForKey:`, you'll need to update your code to account for this.
